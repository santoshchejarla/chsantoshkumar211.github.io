 <h2>Summer School at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Israel.</h2>

_Sometimes we need to look beyond what we believe exists and what is possible for ourselves. We can do this by allowing ourselves to open our eyes to new possibilities._

Last Summer I got a phenomenal opportunity to explore places beyond my country, an opportunity that taught me many lessons, an opportunity that made me do many adventures, an opportunity to explore different cultures and people, and an opportunity that left me with an indelible experience that I would cherish my whole life.

Last summer I got a chance to attend "Data mining and BI for Cybersecurity" summer school at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Israel.


***The Travel Episode***


After a long process of applying for Ben-Gurion University, getting accepted and getting my visa stamped, I finally boarded my flight from Kochi to Tel-Aviv via Delhi (along with my classmate Gopa Vasasnth and Senior Venu Vardhan) with a lot of excitement.



***Whole Israel in a night***

The night I landed in Israel was Shabbat, which means no train, no bus; everything was literally shut-down. Finally, we (all the Indians ~20) got a train after the Shabbat was over. We were supposed to get down at the next stop and board another train to reach Beer-Sheva. Being an Indian, I thought the next stop would be at least 20 to 30 mins away but I was wrong; it was just 5 to 10 mins away, with me indulging in wrong calculations in my head and Gopa staring at the beautiful buildings of Tel-Aviv. Then suddenly, someone shouted that I should get down. I was in a hurry and ran towards the entrance of the train where I had placed my baggage, took them and got down. After a timelapse of 30 seconds, I realized that I had left my backpack on my seat. I saw the door in front of me closing and rushed in through the next door of the train, which was about to close, got my bag and ran back to get off but the doors were locked.  Having no money in my hand, no sim card to contact someone, and not knowing the local language, I was more than a little panicked at my scary prospects. The in-charge of the train advised me to drop down at the next station and get the next train on the next platform. I did get down at the next station but was confused about what to do next. Suddenly, to my surprise, I got a message from Venu Anna on telegram!! Thanks to Israel’s free Railway Wi-Fi, Venu Anna messaged me the same thing as the in-charge said and also added "COME BACK SAFELY WITH TWO BAGS". At first I thought it was just a typo but when a second later Gopa also texted me "DID YOU GET THE BAGS?", I realised it was nothing of the sort. Guess what, Gopa also forgot his backpack!! I didn't know that. After a moment, my counselor messaged me wondering when I'll be reaching the university...I told him about the situation. He called me via WhatsApp and spoke with the Incharge of the Station, who also said the same thing—go to the other platform and get the next train. If I encountered any problem, he told me to mention his name "DAVID". When I got the next train, I reached my friends and Priya Chechi, who were waiting for me. In the meantime, they had inquired about how to get the lost bags and were told to go to the last stop of the Israel "NAHARIYA". We (me, Gopa, Venu Anna and Priya Chechi, who wished to accompany us) took the next train to Nahariya at around 22:00 and reached the destination at around 00:00. We talked to the station master and got the bag safely!!! All that was left then was getting to our University, which is in the opposite corner of Israel. Again, we boarded the train at 1:00 and had to change to another train in between to get to Beer-Sheva. We boarded the next train, which was supposed to stop at Beer-Sheva north (the closest station to our university), and yeah, as usual, we got another surprise—it didn't stop! It went straight to Beer-Sheva central, and by that time it was almost 5:00 the next day. We once again dragged ourselves to the station master and got the right info about which train to board. In the end, we managed to board the right train and alighted at Beer-Sheva north, where we had the pleasure of watching the sun cast a baleful yet sarcastic eye upon us. From there, we got a taxi to our dorms, finally! The dorms were amazing BTW!

***The Campus***

Coming to campus life is just enriching. You can see students from all over the globe and faculty taking classes in shorts, Internet speed touching 1.5 Gbps :) There is also a state-of-the-art library, and the faculty was amazing and friendly too. Honorable mention for the coffee-making machines in every class: if you are a coffee lover, you'll definitely enjoy attending lectures with a hot coffee whenever you are sleepy.

***The Classes***

The classes started with an intro to ML and data mining followed by ML for Cybersecurity, basics of Blockchain, etc. I felt that the classes were a little fast-paced but then my background in cybersecurity helped me to follow the lectures. All the people who tutored us in class were notable in the field of cybersecurity and ML. They gave us an overview of their research too along with the regularly scheduled classes. We also got previews for their talks in blackhat 2019 from some of the faculty (and also from some startups, which I will talk about later in this post).

The strength of the whole class was 40, I guess, and Indians + Chinese made up more than 50% of the class lol!! There were students from Greece, Spain, Mexico, USA, Chile, etc (4 Israelis too). This gave me an opportunity to explore different cultures and, being the youngest among all the students of the class, I took the freedom to ask some crazy questions. Most of the students were graduates with the majority of the Chinese doing their M.S in Math, a Professor from Chile, Researchers from Japan, etc. I'm literally the kid of the class.

Special Mentions: Moran, Ben (Israelis); Angel (Spain); Pepe (Mexico); Patricio (Chile); Xiao Xiao Ma (China); Taniya, Naveen (Indians); Peggy (Taiwan)

***Life in Beer-Sheva***

The campus is located in the city of Beer-Sheva. It's not a big city; in fact, I accidentally crossed the city when I went out for a casual walk once. But the city!! Man, the entire city has an odor. The market near our dorms was the best place to hang out in our free time, but the old city is no exception.

***The Dead-Sea***

Our first field trip, hehe!! On the way to the Dead Sea, we visited Ein-Gedi, the Negev—the house and tomb of Ben-Gurion. You can find Mahatma Gandhi's portrait in Ben-Gurion's bedroom. As Apple says, "There are crazy people we can't just ignore because they push the human race forward, and while some may see them as crazy ones, we see them as geniuses." I would say Ben-Gurion is one of them. There's so much I can write about him, but I'll stop it here.

Finally! The Dead Sea with Jordan on the other side is the lowest point on earth and has an abnormally high salt content. In fact, the concentration is so high that we can float on water; you can't just enter the Dead Sea without shoes because of the salt crystals covering the entire earth below water.


***The Sabbath***

We had our first sabbath near the Dead Sea. One of the most important parts and the part which I love is the Sabbath dinner. The Dinner starts with a prayer and alcohol followed by a grand dinner. Although I didn't like the main course, the desserts will stand out.

***The Jerusalem***

Aaaaahh!! Jerusalem, what should I tell you about Jerusalem? Umbrella Street? The Western Wall? The Last Supper? The Jaffa Gate? The Sunset at Mt. Olives? The Garden Tomb? The Night-life??

We stayed in Jerusalem for 2 days. After our visit to The Western Wall and other important places, we went to the Jerusalem Night Market; we celebrated Naveen's bday there.

“TRAVELING – IT LEAVES YOU SPEECHLESS, THEN TURNS YOU INTO A STORYTELLER.” – IBN BATTUTA

In each and every place I visited in Jerusalem, there is a story to tell, but I don't want to make this blog a big book. So, I'll stop here, but believe me, you can see a glow in my eyes when I hear the word "Jerusalem".

***The IV***

They took us to Tel-Aviv where almost all the companies and start-ups were clustered. The companies we visited are Verint, Checkpoint, and IBM (Beer-Sheva).

They were very happy to receive us and share with us the work they are doing, and also gave us an overview of the real-world threats that a lot of companies face each day.

***The Final Project, Test, and Graduation***

As Gopa was busy with his GSoC 2019 project, Venu Anna and I had to do the major part of the project. We successfully finished the project and presented it at the IT Center of the Beer-Sheva, then came the test. None of us was really prepared for the test, but every one of us was able to make it out somehow. Finally, the Graduation day, yay!! All of us took our graduation in our traditional clothes. You can find Chinese and Indians catching everyone's eye in the university, as our traditional clothing is quite unique compared to other countries.

***The Tel-Aviv and Haifa***

After graduation day, we (Venu Anna, Gopa, Me, Taniya and Swapnil) left for Haifa. The beauty of Haifa just swept me off my feet. I didn't get much time to explore Haifa completely, but the whole city looked like a finely crafted piece of art to me.

Haifa - Bahá'í Gardens and the beaches are a must-visit place in Haifa.


![Haifa](../images/blog/bgu/haifa.jpg)

Tel-Aviv - The silicon valley of the Middle East, the party land, the city that never sleeps...they call it, and yeah, that's true. We (Gopa, Venu Anna and I) spent 2 days in Tel-Aviv. We stayed at Chetana Amma's house, a follower of Mata Amritanandamayi, for the two days. She was so happy to receive us; she treated us like her grandchildren, and she also took us for their family Shabbat dinner as well. I'm so happy to have someone who made us feel at home in Israel. The conversation that I had with her the night before I left Israel is something very valuable to me—she shared her experience and the lessons she learned in her long journey of 70 years. The last two days were amazing, being both emotional and adventurous.

***The FOOD***
 
Coming to food... wherever you go in Israel, you'll find Hummus and Falafel. Personally, I don't like hummus, but it really depends on the brand. Falafel, however, is something else! It tastes really good and is easily among the best Israeli dishes. I survived mostly on Falafel. The meat doesn't look that fresh, but you'll find Shawarma everywhere—again, the freshness depends on the place where you buy it. I found meat in Jerusalem good compared to any other place in Israel. The whole experience of food is not great for me, it was okayish. But if you're a fan of desserts, you'll find heaven there, trust me.

***Back to INDIA***

I would say I made a great decision applying to this university. The exposure, the friends, the experience and the knowledge I gained here is priceless. Anytime in the future, if I ever want to have a great holiday, I'll definitely fly to Israel and complete the things I wanted to do but didn't work out due to lack of time, like visiting Eilat, Bethlehem, partying in Tel-Aviv, etc. With great respect towards the Nation, Ben-Gurion and a big sack of life-lasting memories, I took the flight back to India.

*Finally, I would say*, it's not the destination where you end up but the mishaps and memories you create along the way. The whole experience was enriching, magical, intense, scary. It paved a way for me to make a difference, a better version of myself.
