<h2>Philosophizing on University Debt: A Personal Perspective</h2>

Please keep in mind that the following is my personal opinion and I am not encouraging anyone to adopt my views or perspective. My financial background and personal circumstances may differ greatly from others, thus my opinions may only be relevant to my own situation.


<h3> Mysterious thing Time: Time storage in the form of money</h3>

I think before talking about debt I should share my openion on Time and it's connection with money. Money is the greatest invention of mankind because of is ability to buy time.

I strongly believe that the greates asset anyone can hold is time. With our current understanding of the world and knowledge of physics, we as humans can not control time. Though we can not create time, we can:

1. Store time
2. Buy Time

<br>
<b>1. Storing Time:</b> Storing time is nothing but converting the time you have into wealth, and wealth has many forms. There are two categories of wealth 
    1. Physical wealth: Can be money, gold, land, equity etc.
    2. Psychological wealth: Can be health, memories, satisfaction, relaxation, happiness etc.

Now, when I work I am spending my time and I am getting paid in the form of money (can be salary or profit in business). This is nothing but storing my time in the form of money - physical wealth. When I spend my time with my family, friends or myself I am storing my time in the form of a memory. Ultimately at the end the Psychological wealth matters the most, but to buy it I need the spend the time. So, instead of spending the time with work converting to physical walth and then converting it to psychological wealth, why not spend the time with family or friend creting the physical wealth directly? That's where the concept of buying time helped me to understand the relation between time and money better.

<b>2. Buying Time:</b> I would say the value of time differs. My value of one second is different from a person with different skills, thats because of the leverage the skills one has will give you. For the one second of time I spend at an employeer I maybe get paid one dollar, but another person maybe a security guard at the same office may get 50 cents for the same one second. But there will be many situations where the outpt produced by me and the security guard will the same, say I need groceries, I need to travel to the grocery store find the items, bill them then get the groceries back to home. Even for the security guard the time and the output will be the same. But since the outputs are different from the job we do, I have more money than the security guard and I can use that money to buy the time of security guard, send him to buy the groceries while I can spend the time with myself or talking with my mom or just relaxing. I worked durign the job hours, earned the physical wealth, bought the time of the security guard with this physical wealth and converted the time I saved into psychological wealth. But the security guard did not get a chance to create the phychological wealth, he might be happy doing the job, but over a period of few years, the psychological wealth I would have accumicalted will be much higher than the psychological wealth the guard would have earned. 

Based on the level of leverge you have you can buy time that is many times higher than than the time you spend. If you have hundred tasks to complete, and each task takes 1 day finish. You can use the skill you have, work for a minimum number of day that will allow you to but the hundred days of time and use it, mean while you can go on exploring phuchologcal wealth. The minumum number of days that you should work varies on the leverage the skill you have will give, for some people the minimum number of days can be one, for other it can be twenty. This way you can get more tasks done and accumilate psychological wealth.

Why did difference arise? The answer is simple, the value of time differs a lot based on the skills one has. This difference of value of time gives us the ability to buy time as it's not 1:1 convertion. 

Health: An often overlooked aspect of phychological wealth by students. To even spend the time and gather other psychological wealth one should be healthy, bad health does not produce any outcome not only for you, I has a cascading effect on out families and friends too. If I am sick, there is no way my family can accumulate any kind of phychological wealth of happiness, satisfaction, relaxation or even can damage their health. So, health is the ultimate form of wealth is health. Can we buy health? the answer is partly yes. Most of the diseases are curable nowadays as more diseases will be curable going forward. But, not evey disease will demand the same amount of money to get cured. So, best thing we can do is to be ready to face the dangers. Some of the way that can buy health:
1. Buy and eat good food, maintain a proper diet.  
2. Excercise whenever possible
3. If you are sick, you can buy your health back by consulting a doctor.
4. You can save youself from damaging your health by buying a car that's more safer (whihc is often costlier)
5. Buying your house at a community that has lesser pollution

And there are many other way to maintain good healt. but almost all of them will demand physical wealth, which inturn demands your time, which inturn demands you to be healthy to work. It's deadlock. Can this deadlock be broken? Yes by spending the time you have when you are healthy, and accumilating more physical wealth, which will be enough for you to stop working when you are sick.


Whith the convertion of time in mind, let's talk about university educaiton.

- My Deliberate Choice to Attend a Highly Ranked University
    - People often refer to "Being at the right place at the right time, with right people" as luck. While I do not disagree with them, I also do not agree with them. You can force this to happen, by forcing you to be with the people who are intellectually superior to you. It's strategy is similar to the strategy that venture capitalists often follow, out of thousands of startups that pitch to them, they invest in hundreds of startups. For them investing in one right start up is enough to offset the losses they get from hundreds of startups. Similarly, of the lakhs of students, thousands will get into the top ranked universities, so by investing yourself into a top ranked university allows you to find the few students with whom you can discusses great ideas, and out of many conversations with them if you are lucky you can find the "one" conversation that puts you in the "right place, right time, right people" category. If you choose to be the lower ranked univeristy you can rarely find students who can make the "right place, right time, right people" situation happen for you as they are the thousands of startups rejected by the VC's and you can not find success in those startups.

    - "Network is your Net worth" is a very popular openion. But, what's network? who's in this network? should I just call all of my class mates as my network? Probably not, choosing your netwok is also important. 

    These are some instances from my life. 
     - Joining India's No.1 CTF Team: Joining bi0s - which is a cybersecurity team at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham is accidental. I was walking with two of my friends Vinay and Sumanth back to hostel after classes. Vinay asked us to come with him to the bi0s lab as he talk with the mentor of the team on how to join the team, he asked us to just wait behind him while he talks to the mentor. We were ok to wait, so we went to the lab and the mentor of the team came to the entrance of the lab took all of us to a meeting room, eventhough we said only vinay is planning to join the team. All of sat in the meeting room and vinay was discussing about his interest in joining the team and what he should do to join the team. After listening to vinay, the mentor asked me and sumanth what were we doing after class hourse and why we were not a part of any club on campus. We said we are new to computer science, we dont have any programming experience. He asked why are you not joining now, we are almost at the end on the semester and you should have leared at least one programming language by now in this semester. Before we answered the question, he said you are just passing the time, not trying to learn anything. If you were really interested, you should have leared atleast one of the programming languages by now. I will give you one week, and this the website in which you should solve programming problems, solve atleast 30 of them within this week and meet me after that. These few lines raied the ego in me. As the mentor asked I solved the problems on the website and went back to him showing the results and joined the club. If I was at the unviersity or vinay is not the friend of mine or now walking with him back to the hostel after classes, I would not have joined the club. Joining the club gave rise of a lot of other opportunities in my academic career and onle of the factors that got me into the Big Ten.

    - Summer schoolt at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev: This is another intrerest and accidental opportunity that had a good impact in the life. One day during my udergrad, I was at my universities dining hall, I tpok the food into my plate and was searching a place where I can sit. Then I found on of my very friendly seniors Phani, who is my flat mate now here at UIUC. I went ahead and sat with him to have my breakfast, during our conversation, he asked me why don't you apply for the summer exchange programs abroad? I was not even awar that such program exist. Then he said some of his classmates went to attend a summer school program at BGU the previous year and I should try that. This few minutes of conversation changed my whole summer that year. Attending BGU was one of the major events of my life, I made new friends, explored Israel, got to know about the Jewish community, and gained so much knowledge from the program. This again boils down to being at the right place at the right time with the right people. By making the choice of attending Amrita for my education and making good friends there, I foriced this lucky incident happen. 

- Prioritizing Education and Letting Go of Unnecessary Things
    - When in doubt I find retracing my steps be a wise decision
- Embracing the Risk of Debt in Pursuit of Education:
        - The Satisfaction of a Life Well-Lived and Educated
        - Health
        - pecimisstic vs pratical optimism

- It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live
